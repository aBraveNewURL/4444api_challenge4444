## The challenge for this assignment is to create a timed JavaScript quiz that gives and ranks scores
Once the start button is clicked the test timer begins. Incorrect answers deduct 5sec from the remaining time (left short at 15 seconds for grading and testing convenience.) Once all questions are answered OR the clock runs out, the test is finished and the score is presented alonside a field in which the user can enter their initials. Both the user and their score are added to localStorage.![grab](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108553499/184690311-958dafcd-9678-410b-a5d0-850f290b5ad0.jpg)
